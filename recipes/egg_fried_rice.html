        <p><strong>What is Egg Fried Rice?</strong></p>
        <p>Egg Fried Rice (蛋炒饭) is one of the most popular choices at a Chinese restaurant. 
            It's a very quick stir-fry rice dish that consists of fluffy rice, beaten egg, seasoned with soy sauce, 
            sesame oil, and green onions. </p>
        <p>One one of my favorite recipes in Asian cuisine. 
            I enjoy serving it with a side of bok choy to make it a complete meal.</p>
